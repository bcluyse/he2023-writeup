In the file, we can hear a spanish lady saying numbers. I used a transcription service which I use for my job but there are sufficient services online which do this free (or run locally or try to listen yourself :) ).

It seems like the sequence is binary with decimal numbers in between.
After removing every odd number you should get a binary sequence like the following ( I had to adjust the first byte since something was wrongly detected there)

```
011100011 11001010 01100100 01100000 01100100 01100110 11110110 10011000 01100010 11100110 11101000 11001010 11011100 11010010 11011100 11001110 10111110 11101000 11011110 10111110 11100110 11100000 11110010 10111110 11000110 01100000 11011010 11011010 11101010 11011100 11010010 11000110 11000010 11101000 01100010 11011110 11011100 11100110 1111101
