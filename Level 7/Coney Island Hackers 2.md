The hint heavily refers to eval being used.
I quickly tried to figure out if this was referring to javascript or python by adding some basic syntax in the input 1 || 2 does not throw and is only valid syntax in javascript.

First, I tested with the given password 'y' to see if all letters are blocked.
That does not seem the case, only standard european alphabet is blocked
Afterwards, I started building an alphabet to try to enter it.

cone'y'island at least requires the following letters: coneislad
The simple way to get to these are by using the following.
(If this step is hard to follow, maybe have a look at e.g. JSFuck for a more extensive explanation)

```
!1+''     false
1+{}      [object object]
[][0]+''  undefined
```

I used the greek alphabet for variable names since $ and _ are not allowed and they are more readable.
```
input="β=!1+'';α={}+1;δ=α.α+'';α[5]+α[1]+δ[1]+δ[3]+'ʸ'+δ[5]+β[3]+β[2]+β[1]+δ[6]+δ[8]"
```

However, after doing an initial attempt with this alphabet, I had too many input characters, so I decided to combine two in a variable which comes up with 74 characters

```
input="α=(β=''+!1+{}).β+'';β[10]+β[6]+α[1]+α[3]+'ʸ'+α[5]+β[3]+β[2]+β[1]+α[1]+α[2]"
```

The platform will then return the flag.
