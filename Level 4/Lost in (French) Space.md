I first plotted out the points on a map:

48.998,2.008,red
45.960,0.090,blue
43.579,1.524,yellow
45.007,4.335,green


All locations seem cosmology related.
Red -> parc aux etoiles in paris, seems like an old observatory

Blue -> empty streets on first sight

Yellow -> board 'Sentier des planetes' containing a lot of information on Jupiter

Green -> Plan√®te Mars Observatoire Hubert Reeves

So if we go to some site, looking for Mars maps, we can find
